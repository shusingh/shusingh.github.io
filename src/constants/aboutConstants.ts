  DESCRIPTION: `
  I'm Shubham, a Software Engineer at Amazon where I design and build both backend and frontend systems that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain. I enjoy simplifying complex problems and creating solutions that improve internal workflows, enhance user experience, and stand the test of time.
  <br /><br />
  I believe engineering starts with empathy. Understanding user needs is key to architecting effective systems and features. This approach has helped me streamline complex processes, cutting onboarding times from weeks to hours and empowering users with self-service data ingestion pipelines. Outside of work, I enjoy developing full-stack side projects that combine intuitive UX with solid backend infrastructure.
  <br /><br />
  When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, exploring photography with my Fujifilm X100VI, or lost in a good book. I'm driven by curiosity and the constant pursuit of learning and mastering new skills.
