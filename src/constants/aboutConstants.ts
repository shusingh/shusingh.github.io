  DESCRIPTION: `
  I'm Shubham, a <span class="highlight">Software Development Engineer II at Amazon</span> with 3+ years of experience building distributed systems, LLM-powered platforms, and large-scale compliance infrastructure on AWS. I specialize in designing <span class="highlight">production-grade AI systems</span>, high-reliability orchestration pipelines, and self-service tooling that simplifies complex workflows.
  <br /><br />
  I believe engineering starts with empathy. Understanding user needs is key to architecting effective systems and features. This approach has helped me automate <span class="highlight">~80% of manual compliance workflows</span> using LLM systems, cut onboarding times from <span class="highlight">weeks to hours</span> with self-service platforms, and build robust data pipelines processing <span class="highlight">30M+ monthly records</span>. Outside of work, I enjoy building side projects exploring AI/ML, distributed systems, and full-stack development.
  <br /><br />
  When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, exploring photography with my Fujifilm X100VI, or lost in a good book. I'm driven by curiosity and the constant pursuit of learning and mastering new skills.
